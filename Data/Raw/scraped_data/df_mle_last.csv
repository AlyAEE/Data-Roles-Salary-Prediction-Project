8,"Research Scientist, Machine Learning / AI",-1,"About Basis
Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

33,Patent Engineer / Scientist - Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning,Employer Provided Salary:$60K - $100K,"Osha Bergman Watanabe & Burton LLP (OBWB) is currently seeking candidates with a background in machine learning or artificial intelligence for our team responsible for preparing and prosecuting patent applications. Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply. Candidates should enjoy drafting narrative and persuasive documents while critically analyzing and solving problems. Time management skills are also critical.

Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply. Candidates should enjoy drafting narrative and persuasive documents while critically analyzing and solving problems. Time management skills are also critical.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

Your work will have a tremendous direct impact on both provider and patient-facing ML-augmented applications, thereby providing low-friction, high-quality care to patients of Curai Health.

We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.

We are excellent collaborators, within our team and across teams with product owners, engineers, and clinicians to deliver automated products for doctors and patients. A successful candidate will own and help engineer end-to-end, AI/ML-powered automated systems in service of better health outcomes at lower costs.

What You’ll Do
Design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning models, including those that are based on large language models. These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.
Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.
Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.
Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.

What You’ll Need
“End-to-end” experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.
Experience in natural language processing applications
""Product sense"" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.
Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams.

Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.

728,"Research Scientist, Machine Learning / AI",-1,"About Basis
Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.

Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply. Candidates should enjoy drafting narrative and persuasive documents while critically analyzing and solving problems. Time management skills are also critical.

Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply. Candidates should enjoy drafting narrative and persuasive documents while critically analyzing and solving problems. Time management skills are also critical.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you're building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
Nice to Haves:
You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You're proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.

You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

818,"Research Scientist, Machine Learning / AI",-1,"About Basis
Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.

PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems

Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role
We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion's product in a high quality way. You'll be exploring the boundaries of what's possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion's offering.
What You'll Achieve:
Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion's core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 6+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You're excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you're building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
Nice to Haves:
You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You're proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals' strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
