The Empire State Building Observatory (ESBO) is New York’s City most iconic, the most Instagrammed U.S. landmark, and the world’s most famous building that has wowed millions of global visitors as they witnessed the jaw dropping views whether from its popular 360-degree, open-air Observatory, or its 102nd floor floor-to-ceiling glass enclosed viewing gallery. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Empire State Realty Trust.
The team at ESBO is a collection of diverse individuals with a shared passion for excellence. We seek an equally passionate sales professional to join our team who will understand the essential elements to scale the company’s revenue streams, to optimize yield/per capita income, develop and lead this newly created department.

Within the museum’s more than one dozen memorable moments, we could not resist but sprinkle a little extra fun with the inclusion of our Kong exhibit where visitors walk through an office from the 1930’s complete with the famous, giant ape's fingers pierce the walls as he dangles from the building and dodges vintage fighter planes. Those brave enough can even step into Kong's hands – but beware, you might feel the power of this fearsome ape firsthand!
The renovations also include industry-leading Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) improvements such as bi-polar ionization, MERV 13 filters, and increased ventilation that led to the building’s achievement as the first building in the Americas to receive the WELL Health-Safety Rating.
Overall, the Guest feedback has been stellar! New York Times’ quote: “…exhilarating and intimate.”
The Empire State Building Observatory has evolved from a general admissions model to a timed-ticketed attraction. This results in a myriad of exciting benefits to include capacity controls by revenue segment, variable prices, and overall capacity controls to manage demand.
Do you define success as the ability to increase market share, grow revenues? Do you thrive on negotiations, securing favorable contract terms with clients, presenting value prepositions? Possess a customer-centric mindset and entrepreneurial spirit?

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Founded in 2017 on the premise that ""health is local"" and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs along with some of the top healthcare investors in the country.
Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings.
In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.
Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.
Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To close gaps in care and advance equity in the communities we serve, we have to start with making our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bringing together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to ensure that every person on the Cityblock team, and every Cityblock member, feels supported and included as a part of our community.

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Professional standards expected of all employees:

Professionally interacts and maintains effective and open communication with all personnel, vendors/manufacturers and customers
Maintains a professional and positive manner and appearance at all times
Performs all duties safely and in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures of SmarterTravel

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Professionally interacts and maintains effective and open communication with all personnel, vendors/manufacturers and customers

This requires working independently, collaborating, and engaging within the college’s institutional effectiveness (IE) team with administrators, faculty, and staff from across the college.

Analysts should be curious, critical thinkers who desire to develop and enhance their technical skillset. Successful analysts can balance a high-level perspective of business problems with the technical details needed to provide solutions. They demonstrate some degree of “business sense,” with the ability to think in terms of the administrators they are assisting while at the same time maintaining a more in-depth understanding of the data and related technical components needed to address the problem.

The Empire State Building Observatory (ESBO) is New York’s City most iconic, the most Instagrammed U.S. landmark, and the world’s most famous building that has wowed millions of global visitors as they witnessed the jaw dropping views whether from its popular 360-degree, open-air Observatory, or its 102nd floor floor-to-ceiling glass enclosed viewing gallery. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Empire State Realty Trust.
The team at ESBO is a collection of diverse individuals with a shared passion for excellence. We seek an equally passionate sales professional to join our team who will understand the essential elements to scale the company’s revenue streams, to optimize yield/per capita income, develop and lead this newly created department.
The ESBO has recently undergone a top-to-bottom renovation that includes a dedicated Guest entrance, an immersive, tactile, and digital museum that celebrates our icon from the moment it was conceived to its place today in pop-culture, and a completely re-imagined 102nd floor viewing experience (www.esbnyc.com). Within the museum’s more than one dozen memorable moments, we could not resist but sprinkle a little extra fun with the inclusion of our Kong exhibit where visitors walk through an office from the 1930’s complete with the famous, giant ape's fingers pierce the walls as he dangles from the building and dodges vintage fighter planes. Those brave enough can even step into Kong's hands – but beware, you might feel the power of this fearsome ape firsthand!
The renovations also include industry-leading Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) improvements such as bi-polar ionization, MERV 13 filters, and increased ventilation that led to the building’s achievement as the first building in the Americas to receive the WELL Health-Safety Rating.
Overall, the Guest feedback has been stellar! New York Times’ quote: “…exhilarating and intimate.”
The Empire State Building Observatory has evolved from a general admissions model to a timed-ticketed attraction. This results in a myriad of exciting benefits to include capacity controls by revenue segment, variable prices, and overall capacity controls to manage demand.
Do you define success as the ability to increase market share, grow revenues? Do you thrive on negotiations, securing favorable contract terms with clients, presenting value prepositions? Possess a customer-centric mindset and entrepreneurial spirit? Then join our team and experience the rewards of hard work, teamwork, learning, and dedication to create a “best-in-class” sales team that requires excellence in all that we undertake.

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Professional standards expected of all employees:

Professionally interacts and maintains effective and open communication with all personnel, vendors/manufacturers and customers
Maintains a professional and positive manner and appearance at all times
Performs all duties safely and in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures of SmarterTravel
Adheres to all applicable department, production, and company related Operational, Safety and Human Resources policies and procedures

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Professionally interacts and maintains effective and open communication with all personnel, vendors/manufacturers and customers
