"Data Scientist, Product",Employer Provided Salary:$160K - $255K,"About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.

In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products.

The Empire State Building Observatory (ESBO) is New York’s City most iconic, the most Instagrammed U.S. landmark, and the world’s most famous building that has wowed millions of global visitors as they witnessed the jaw dropping views whether from its popular 360-degree, open-air Observatory, or its 102nd floor floor-to-ceiling glass enclosed viewing gallery. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Empire State Realty Trust.
The team at ESBO is a collection of diverse individuals with a shared passion for excellence. We seek an equally passionate sales professional to join our team who will understand the essential elements to scale the company’s revenue streams, to optimize yield/per capita income, develop and lead this newly created department.
The ESBO has recently undergone a top-to-bottom renovation that includes a dedicated Guest entrance, an immersive, tactile, and digital museum that celebrates our icon from the moment it was conceived to its place today in pop-culture, and a completely re-imagined 102nd floor viewing experience (www.esbnyc.com). Within the museum’s more than one dozen memorable moments, we could not resist but sprinkle a little extra fun with the inclusion of our Kong exhibit where visitors walk through an office from the 1930’s complete with the famous, giant ape's fingers pierce the walls as he dangles from the building and dodges vintage fighter planes. Those brave enough can even step into Kong's hands – but beware, you might feel the power of this fearsome ape firsthand!
The renovations also include industry-leading Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) improvements such as bi-polar ionization, MERV 13 filters, and increased ventilation that led to the building’s achievement as the first building in the Americas to receive the WELL Health-Safety Rating.
Overall, the Guest feedback has been stellar! New York Times’ quote: “…exhilarating and intimate.”
The Empire State Building Observatory has evolved from a general admissions model to a timed-ticketed attraction. This results in a myriad of exciting benefits to include capacity controls by revenue segment, variable prices, and overall capacity controls to manage demand.
Do you define success as the ability to increase market share, grow revenues? Do you thrive on negotiations, securing favorable contract terms with clients, presenting value prepositions? Possess a customer-centric mindset and entrepreneurial spirit? Then join our team and experience the rewards of hard work, teamwork, learning, and dedication to create a “best-in-class” sales team that requires excellence in all that we undertake.

SmarterTravel’s Leadership Principles
Take Big Swings - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what’s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team’s time and effort.
Data Driven - Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.
Make Moonshine - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They’re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.
Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.
Bias for Action - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don’t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.
Have Integrity; Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.
Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.
Ownership - Leaders think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
Disagree and Commit - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.
Dive Deep - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
Deliver Results - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Professionally interacts and maintains effective and open communication with all personnel, vendors/manufacturers and customers

"Data Scientist IV, SSP",$118K - $161K (Glassdoor est.),"The InMobi Story

We like big challenges. Building a new company in 2007 was no ordinary task. As the recession hit, the iPhone was born and launched a revolution. Mobile advertising wasn't yet a thing, other than SMS, and venture capital funding was hard to come by for four guys in India.

Yet with passion, foresight, and conviction, InMobi charted its own course - helping to transform the way consumers engage with their phones and create today's booming app economy wherein consumers now spend 4.2 hours per day.

After fourteen years of innovation, our end-to-end advertising software platform, connected content and commerce experiences have formed a powerful engine for growth that activates audiences, drives real connections, and diversifies revenue for companies around the world.

Our global organization of InMobians are excited to continue discovering and developing impactful technologies that will continue to transform people, businesses, and society.

"Data Scientist, Product",Employer Provided Salary:$160K - $255K,"About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.

Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Degree in statistics, econometrics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or equivalent/related degree.
2+ years of experience in software development life cycle and/or project life cycle activities on development and maintenance projects.
2+ years of experience in building and applying machine learning models for causal inference, attribution, forecasting, segmentation, or optimization.
Understanding of data integration, data quality and data architecture.
Experience in preparing test scripts and test cases to validate data and maintaining data quality.
Knowledge of large data sets and experience with performance tuning and troubleshooting.
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn an advanced degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply.

"Software Engineer, Machine Learning",Employer Provided Salary:$220K - $300K,"About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role
We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion's product in a high quality way. You'll be exploring the boundaries of what's possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion's offering.
What You'll Achieve:
Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion's core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 6+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You're excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you're building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
Nice to Haves:
You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You're proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals' strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Data Engineer,$99K - $136K (Glassdoor est.),"The company

Decentralized data is the future. Data mesh is the right idea. We’re here to make it a reality. Nextdata OS is a data-mesh-native platform built to meet the challenge of decentralizing data at scale. We are inventing a new way for developers to work with data and share it responsibly via data product containers.

Our vision is to build a world where AI/ML and analytics are powered by decentralized, responsible, and equitable data ownership, across boundaries of organizations, technology, and most importantly boundaries of trust.

Our purpose is to change the experience of creating, sharing, discovering, and using data forever, to be connected, fast, and fair based on data mesh principles.

Our technology is designed to empower data developers, users and owners with a delightful experience where data products are a first-class primitive, with trust built-in.

We are here to accept the reality that the world of data is complex and messy; data models are out-of-date the moment they are created; data is owned across trust boundaries; data is stored on different platforms; data is used in many different modes and most importantly data can't protect itself. We are here to recognize that past approaches to tackle these complexities with centralized data collection, modeling and governance are ineffective at best and pathologically unfair at worst. We are here to reimagine, with you!

The role

You will be one of the first data product developers building data products on top of the Nextdata OS. You will work with Nextdata’s initial customers to translate their business needs into PoC data products that you will then build on top of our OS.
You will leverage your experience of the full lifecycle of analytics - translating business requirements to data models, to data pipelines, to analytics dashboards and even machine learning pipelines - to build data products and then provide feedback that will help us improve the Nextdata OS and tooling.

You will manage the full lifecycle of the PoC data products from ideation around business use case to successful deployment, including synthesizing realistic data for testing before deploying into production.

Our expectations

You have worked on complex data pipelines in large data organizations. You have dealt with the uncertainty of iterating from at times an under defined business use case to a concrete end-to-end analytics pipeline that drives value to the business. You may have had to help the business quantify the value of your analyses as well!
You are proficient in the modern data stack tools like airflow, dagster, prefect, dbt and ML development environments like PySpark and Pandas.
You are articulate and are able to present your findings in a compelling manner.
You have relied on continuous integration and continuous deployment to reduce software lead time, and have contributed to optimizing build and release processes as needed.
You have shown evidence that you aspire to test-first data pipeline development!

Our benefits

We are an early stage company, but we don't subsist on ramen! We are an experienced team with families. We provide $6000 for your home workspace setup, premium health, vision, dental insurance coverage for you and your family.
